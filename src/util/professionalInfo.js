        "At Devsinc (July 2025 - present), I built an agentic chatbot with LLM function calling that autonomously handles multi-step booking flows, reducing customer drop-off. I engineered a browser extension that cut content team's prompt engineering time by 50% through automatic context scraping. I delivered the Diamond Paints dashboard with sub-2s load times via bundle optimization and lazy loading. I built REST APIs with Node.js/Express and implemented Redux Toolkit for state management and Sentry for error monitoring.",
